Weeping Plebs is a unique NFT project on Base Network, spearheaded by the trusted founder ZerpsNpurps, known for their expertise in navigating the crypto world with finesse. With extensive experience in NFT collections across various blockchains and a dedicated team from successful projects, ZerpsNpurps is thrilled to embark on this journey. Creating a concept entirely with his team on their own, this  is a breath of fresh air and a new form of expression.
Lets get into it:
These modern 90s-style cartoon characters, known as the Weeping Plebs, reside deep within the heart of Base Network. Having journeyed across multiple blockchains, layer 2s, and other networks, they seek to rebuild from past failures and find peace and harmony. Despite their penchant for ignoring advice about promising crypto and NFT investments from friends, their journey is marked by humorous missteps. Through humor and relatable content, the project aims to educate, entertain, and foster a like-minded community within the Base Network ecosystem.

Why Base Network? For a detailed explanation, join our AMAs and engage with our team in chat. Essentially, we believe Base Network, backed by Coinbase, will play a pivotal role beyond the current bull run. Being early is crucial, and we are proud to make our mark on this network.

Project & Community Goals:

Targeted animation/gif marketing aimed at influencers, CEOs, and enthusiasts within the Base, crypto, and NFT communities.
An original short animated series that delves into the lore of the Weeping Plebs to build culture and add value, with extensive marketing for maximum exposure. We believe that with community support for our animation, dedication, and gaming initiatives, the sky is the limit!
